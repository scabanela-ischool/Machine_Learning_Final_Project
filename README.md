# Machine Learning Final Project

**Description:** This repo contains work for a group final project I worked on for the Applied Machine Learning course I took in Spring 2022. The goal of this project was to explore a dataset of our choosing, apply the machine learning algorithms we learned in class, and observe which algorithms performed the best and why.

**How to navigate this repo:**

- final_presentation.html - the file we presented in class
- final_presentation.ipynb - the notebook we used to generate the HTML presentation file
- final_report_code.ipynb - code showing our work
- elevation.html - the file to show the 3D interactive plot in a new browswer tab that we presented in class
- images folder - contains images rendered in our notebooks
- data folder - our forest dataset
